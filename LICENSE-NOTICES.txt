OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE: "Open Source Software" is software that may be 
delivered with the Software and is licensed in accordance with open 
source licenses, including, but not limited to, any software licensed 
under Academic Free License, Apache Software License, Artistic License, 
BSD License, GNU General Public License, GNU Library General Public 
License, GNU Lesser Public License, Mozilla Public License, Python

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES: WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS 
WITH RESPECT TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR 
ADVICE GIVEN BY WIND RIVER, ITS DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS OR 
EMPLOYEES SHALL IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS WARRANTY. Some 
jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of implied 
warranties or how long an implied warranty may last, so the above 
limitations may not apply to Customer. This warranty gives Customer 
specific legal rights and Customer may have other rights that vary from 
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: WIND RIVER AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE 
LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES 
OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, PROCUREMENT 
OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THE LIKE) REGARDLESS OF THE 
FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT 
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, ARISING OUT OF 
OR RELATED TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF WIND RIVER HAS BEEN ADVISED 
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL WIND RIVER'S 
AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED 
TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). Some 
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or 
consequential damages so this limitation and exclusion may not apply to 
Customer. 

THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS 
OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN WIND RIVER AND CUSTOMER. WIND RIVER 
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH 
LIMITATIONS. 

The End
